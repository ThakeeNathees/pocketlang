[How to Install](Installation.html) reference.

## Hello World

Once you're done installing, lets create the classic Hello World in pocketlang by creating an empty file named `hello.pk`
(Note that pocket lang doesn't enforce the `.pk` extension but it's just a convension).

```ruby
print('Hello World')
```

And run the above script with the following command.

```
$ pocket hello.pk
Hello World
```
