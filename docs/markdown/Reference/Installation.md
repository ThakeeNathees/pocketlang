Pocketlang is a small, self contained and standalone language which doesn't require any
installer or setup wizard to install. Just download the pre build pocketlang binary (TODO)
or if you have any c99 compatible compiler in your, you can compile it in seconds (see
[How to Build From Source](Build-From-Source.html)) and add the binary path to your
enviornment path variable.

Once you're done, make sure pocketlang is ready to run with the following version command.

```
$ pocket --version
pocketlang 0.1.0
```
